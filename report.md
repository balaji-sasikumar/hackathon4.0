Hi Balaji,

Thank you for sharing your details. Based on your provided information, you are 25 years old with a blood pressure reading of 120/80 (which is normal), a blood sugar level of 90 mg/dL (which falls within the normal fasting range), and you've experienced a headache for the past two days. Additionally, you mentioned having diabetes.

### Possible Causes for Your Headache:
1. **Tension or Stress**: Stress or muscle tension can often cause headaches.
2. **Dehydration**: Not drinking enough water can lead to headaches.
3. **Blood Sugar Fluctuations**: Although your sugar level appears normal, sudden glucose spikes or drops (especially in people with diabetes) can sometimes trigger headaches.
4. **Eye Strain**: Extended screen time or uncorrected vision issues could induce headaches.
5. **Sinus Pressure or Infection**: Congestion or sinus problems could also be a cause.
6. **Medication or Diet Changes**: If you've recently adjusted any medication for diabetes or changed your eating patterns, this could be influencing your symptoms.

### Basic Remedies for Your Headache:
Here are a few steps you can take to alleviate your headache:
1. **Hydration**: Ensure you are drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Sometimes dehydration is a simple yet overlooked cause of headaches.
2. **Rest & Relaxation**: Take breaks from screens, loud noises, or bright lights. Rest in a quiet, dimly lit room for 20–30 minutes.
3. **Over-the-Counter Pain Relief**: Paracetamol or ibuprofen (if no contraindications for your diabetes) can help relieve headaches. Follow the recommended dosage on the package.
4. **Small Meals**: Since you have diabetes, ensure you are eating small, balanced meals at regular intervals to avoid drastic fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
5. **Gentle Massage**: Massage your temples, neck, or shoulders to relieve tension and improve blood circulation.
6. **Caffeine**: Sometimes, a small dose of caffeine (like tea or coffee) can help alleviate a mild headache. However, avoid overconsumption.
7. **Monitor Triggers**: Keep track of recent lifestyle factors like sleep disruptions, diet, or caffeine intake, which might help identify any headache triggers.

### When to Consult a Doctor:
- If the headache persists beyond a few more days.
- If the headache is severe, worsens over time, or disrupts daily activities.
- If you experience accompanying symptoms like nausea, vision changes, confusion, or fever. 
- If you notice unusually high or low blood sugar levels that might need adjustment in your diabetes management plan.

### Next Steps:
If the headache continues or worsens, I would recommend consulting a healthcare professional for a more detailed evaluation, especially considering your diabetes history.
