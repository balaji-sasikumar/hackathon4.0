AI Health Advisor: Thank you for sharing your details, Balaji! Based on the information, your blood pressure of 120/80 and sugar level of 90 mg/dL are within normal ranges, which is reassuring. However, your headache persisting for the last two days warrants attention, especially since you mentioned being diabetic. Chronic conditions like diabetes can sometimes contribute to symptoms like headaches due to factors like fluctuating blood sugar levels, dehydration, or even stress.

### General Remedies to Try:
1. **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water to ensure you're hydrated; dehydration can cause headaches.
2. **Rest**: Ensure you're getting enough sleep and rest, as lack of sleep may worsen headaches.
3. **Basic Pain Relief**: Over-the-counter medications like paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen can help with headache relief. Be cautious with NSAIDs, especially with diabetes; consult a healthcare professional if unsure.
4. **Check Sugar Levels**: Monitor your blood sugar levels if the headache persists, as extreme fluctuations could be a contributing factor.

### Note of Caution:
Since you have diabetes, consistent or worsening headaches could be a sign of an underlying issue, such as high blood sugar, low blood sugar, or even tension/stress-induced headaches. If these remedies don't help or if symptoms worsen (e.g., nausea, blurred vision, or dizziness), professional evaluation is strongly recommended.
