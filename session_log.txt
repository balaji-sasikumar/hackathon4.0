AI Health Advisor: Hi Balaji, based on the information you've shared:  

Your blood pressure (120/80) and sugar level (90 mg/dL) are within a normal range, which is positive. However, considering you have diabetes and have had a persistent headache for the last 2 days, here are a few thoughts:  

1. **Assessment:** Persistent headaches can be caused by various factors, ranging from dehydration, stress, or tension to blood sugar fluctuations. Diabetes can sometimes contribute to vascular issues, which could cause headaches.
   
2. **General Remedies:**  
   - Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.  
   - Apply a cold or warm compress to your forehead or neck for relief.  
   - Take over-the-counter pain relief like paracetamol or ibuprofen (as long as itâ€™s not contraindicated due to your health conditions).  
   - Rest in a quiet, dark room to help reduce the headache intensity.  
   - Monitor your blood sugar closely to rule out any sudden fluctuations.  

3. **Note of caution:** Since you have diabetes, itâ€™s critical to ensure this headache is not a sign of an underlying issue like hypertension, nerve problems, or low/high blood sugar episodes. Persistent headaches warrant professional evaluation.
