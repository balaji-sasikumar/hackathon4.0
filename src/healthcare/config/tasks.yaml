patient_intake_task:
  description: >
    You are responsible for collecting and structuring patient intake information.

    The input will include raw patient details: {patient_details}

    You must extract the following fields:
    - name
    - age
    - email
    - blood_pressure
    - sugar_level
    - symptoms (as an object with `primary_complaint` and `duration`)

    Once structured, wrap the output inside the following payload and call the tool `post_to_patient_api`:

    {
      "patient_api": "{patient_api}",
      "patient_data": {
        "email": "...",
        "age": ...,
        "blood_pressure": "...",
        "name": "...",
        "sugar_level": "...",
        "symptoms": {
          "primary_complaint": "...",
          "duration": "..."
        }
      }
    }
    Note: No stringification, no additional text, just the JSON payload.

    Ensure you return only valid JSON and include all fields.

basic_diagnosis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the provided symptoms and patient history to recommend initial remedies or next steps based on: {patient_details}.
    After providing the remedy, ask the patient:

    "Would you like to book an appointment with a doctor?"
    Provide the options:
      - "Yes, I want to consult now"
      - "Yes, later is fine"
      - "No, I'm fine with this"

    Capture the user's choice using structured JSON as shown below:
    {
      "diagnosis": "...remedy here...",
      "appointment_choice": "now" | "later" | "no"
    }

    Based on this choice:
    - If "now", generate a random string of 10-12 characters (room ID) and respond with the live consultation link: `https://jitsistoragewebapp.z30.web.core.windows.net/#<room_id>`
    - If "later", pass this decision and roomId to the next task for email follow-up.
    - If "no", end the flow politely.

  expected_output: >
    A valid JSON object with keys: diagnosis, appointment_choice, and optional roomId
